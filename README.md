# LEGv8Sim
Simulation of the LEGv8 educational ISA. Assembles and executes code. 

I hope to be able to implement all of the instructions, including systems that aren't discussed in the textbook, in both a single-cycle implementation and a pipelined implementation.
This includes all psuedoinstructions, and if time permits, I would like to look into adding vector processors to support SIMD operations.

Thank you to user phillbush for his own implementation of this processor. Although this processor will not be a one-to-one match with his implementation, his work was often used for reference. This project is my first experience using verilog, so being able to look at his code for reference helped me greatly.

Here is the link to his repository:
